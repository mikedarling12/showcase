# Farkle

**Language:** C++

## What is it:

This program was made as a final project for a C++ class and stands as a benchmark to compare to my skill level with code as you view my other C++ projects. As the title suggests, this program simulates a game of Farkle.

## How it works:

This simple application acts as a scoreboard and dice roller. This iteration, however, cannot interpret dice results, and will therefore require the user to do so. It provides all other functionality required to play with 2 or more people.
