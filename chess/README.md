# Chess Simulator

**Language:** C++

## What is it:

This program was made for a class to help us practice working in pairs and using classes. In this program, we simulate a game of Chess. Many important rules, such as Castling and En-Passant are present, but some are missing, such as a turn cycle and checking for check and checkmate.

We worked on this project for 6 weeks, starting with some code provided by the professor.

**Note**:
The files that were made by Br. Helfrich, our professor, were these provided files. Everything else was produced by myself and a team member. See File Headers for contributers.
