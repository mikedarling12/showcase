# Item Search

**Language:** Python

## What is it:

This program was made as a final project for a coding class I took early on during college. We were able to choose what we wanted to program, so I made a game that would use JSON packets of info to work like cartridges in a console (in this case, the program). I also have an example JSON file to show how it works.

## How it works:

This program interprets JSON files to build a game environment. As the title suggests, it is a scavenger hunt. You need to get certain items in order to unlock others, etc, until you complete the task. Because of how this program was built, it has configurable malleability, meaning that it can be greatly altered without touching the code.
