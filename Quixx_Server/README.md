# Quixx Server

## A web-based scorecard for the game Quixx

**Languages Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## What is it?

Quixx Server is a digital scorecard designed for the board game Quixx. My family loves playing the game but quickly runs out of physical scorecards. Instead of buying more, I decided to create a digital version that could enhance our gaming experience while helping me build my coding skills.

Initially, I aimed to develop a simple interface that would serve as a scorecard accessible on both phones and computers. As I built the program, I realized its potential and began adding more features.

### Current Features:

- Track scores throughout the game
- Roll the dice for players
- Display available cells based on dice rolls
- Automated penalty marking

### Future Features:

- UI messages to inform users of illegal actions
- A web server or hosting service to allow users to connect and play with friends locally or over different IPs

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Once set up, it should be playable from your browser.
