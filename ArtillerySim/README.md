# Artillery Simulator

**Language:** C++

## What is it:

This program was made for a class to help us practice working in pairs and using classes. In this program, we simulate artillery fire using accurate physics. For simplicity, we did not take air resistance into account, so the primary forces on the shell were gravity and launch velocity.

We worked on this project for 6 weeks, starting with some code provided by the professor.

**Note**:
The files that were made by Br. Helfrich, our professor, were these provided files. Everything else was produced by myself and a team member. See File Headers for contributers.
