# Artillery Simulator

**Language:** C++

## What is it:

This program was made for a class to help us practice working in pairs and using classes. In this program, we simulate landing a lunar rover using accurate physics.

We worked on this project for 6 weeks, starting with some code provided by the professor.

**Note**:
The files that were made by Br. Helfrich, our professor, were these provided files. Everything else was produced by myself and a team member. See File Headers for contributers.
